Hi! I'm Onur Önder. Glad to see you here!

I'm a software developer from İzmir, Turkey. Between 2009 and 2013, I gained a great interest in programming during my education at Ege University Civil Engineering Department and after my graduation. In 2015, I started Ege University Computer Engineering Department in order to turn this interest into a professional gain and graduated in 2018.

At Arkas Holding - Bimar, where I started working as an intern in the last year of my university life, I continued to work for 4 years until I became a mid-level software developer. At Bimar, I took a role in the development of enterprise web and mobile applications with the help of technologies/tools such as TypeScript, JavaScript, React, React Native, .NET Core, MSSQL, Git, Azure and Azure DevOps in a team that follows the Agile/Scrum methodologies.

As of September 2021, I started to work as a Frontend Developer in the web team of Getir. I'm mostly working on JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js and similar frontend technologies.

In my spare time, I contribute to my own development by carrying out projects with technologies such as Node.js (Express, Next.js, Socket.IO etc.), GraphQL, and I try to take part in the open-source community by publishing these projects on GitHub and npm.

I also develop small-scale projects in languages ​​such as Python and Go, as I believe that experiencing different frameworks and programming languages ​​can bring different perspectives to a software developer.
